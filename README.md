###About
This web application allows users to see golf courses based on the location they search, mark the ones they've played, and see contact and website information for potential new courses to play. Users are able to filter viable courses based on public/private, cost, travel distance, etc. Users can also click on each course's address to see the driving directions on Google Maps.

###The Problem
Public golfers have the same difficulty choosing a course to play as people do selecting wine. Few websites show golfers what courses are playable near them and because of this, golfers also forget how many options they have, where they've played, costs, and distances.

This is a front-end-only web application that uses the Swing by Swing API to access specific information per golf course. It cross references that information with the Google Maps API to show per-course markers on the map.

Technologies Used: AngularJS, CSS/Angular Materialize
